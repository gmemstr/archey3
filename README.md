Archey 3 (gmem's fork)
========

Archey3 is primarily aimed at Arch Linux, and as such is primarily tested
on it. However support for other Linux distros is available. 

> Archey 3 is a system infomation printer, designed to be used when taking screenshots of computer desktops to provide additional infomation about the operating system setup. Archey is designed to be used for Arch linux, and it acordingly prints out the Arch linux logo along side the system infomation.

This fork contains temperatures from `sensors` (if available) and also allows the user
to lock their terminal instance with a password.
